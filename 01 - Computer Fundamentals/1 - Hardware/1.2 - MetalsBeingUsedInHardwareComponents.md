## ðŸ§  Why Metals?

Metals are essential in hardware manufacturing because of their:

* **High electrical conductivity** (for circuits)
* **Thermal conductivity** (for heat dissipation)
* **Strength and durability** (for structural parts)
* **Malleability and corrosion resistance**

## ðŸ’¡ Key Notes:

* **Gold and silver are expensive**, so often **only used in small amounts** (contacts, edges, pins).
* **Copper is king** in most circuitry due to its cost-efficiency and high conductivity.
* **Aluminum dominates** structural and thermal roles.
* **Lead is phased out** in modern electronics due to environmental concerns (RoHS compliance).
