#  **`Main Components of a Computer System (Hardware)`**

Think of the computer as a human body:

* The **brain** = CPU
* The **memory** = RAM + Storage
* The **senses and actions** = Input & Output devices
* The **circulatory system** = Motherboard + Buses

Here are the main parts:

1. **Input Devices**

   * Purpose: Allow user or environment to provide data/instructions.
   * Examples: Keyboard, Mouse, Scanner, Microphone, Camera.

2. **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**

   * Purpose: Executes instructions and controls all operations.
   * Subcomponents:

     * **Control Unit (CU)** – Directs flow of data and instructions.
     * **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** – Performs calculations and logical decisions.
     * **Registers** – Small, very fast storage inside CPU for temporary data.
     * **Cache** – High-speed memory closer to CPU for frequently used data.

3. **Memory (Primary Storage)**

   * **RAM (Random Access Memory)** – Stores data and instructions currently being used (volatile).
   * **ROM (Read Only Memory)** – Stores permanent instructions like firmware/boot loader (non-volatile).

4. **Secondary Storage**

   * Purpose: Long-term storage of programs and data.
   * Examples: Hard Disk Drive (HDD), Solid State Drive (SSD), Optical Discs, USB drives.

5. **Output Devices**

   * Purpose: Display or produce processed data in human-readable form.
   * Examples: Monitor, Printer, Speaker, Projector.

6. **Motherboard**

   * Purpose: The main circuit board that connects CPU, memory, storage, and I/O devices.
   * Contains system bus (data bus, address bus, control bus).

7. **Power Supply Unit (PSU)**

   * Converts electricity from wall outlet into the right form for computer components.

## 2. Workflow Outline (How They Work Together)

Let’s walk through the **data flow** step by step:

1. **Input Stage**

   * User gives input through devices (e.g., pressing a key, clicking mouse).
   * Input data is converted into binary signals and sent to CPU via motherboard.

2. **Processing Stage**

   * Control Unit (CU) fetches the instruction from memory.
   * Instruction is decoded (understood) by CPU.
   * Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) performs required operation (calculation, comparison, decision).
   * Registers and Cache provide temporary storage for quick execution.

3. **Memory Interaction**

   * CPU fetches data from RAM (faster but temporary).
   * If not found, it may go to secondary storage (slower but permanent).

4. **Output Stage**

   * After processing, CPU sends results to output devices.
   * Example: Numbers typed → CPU processes → Appears on screen.

5. **Storage**

   * Results can be stored permanently in HDD/SSD.
   * Example: Saving a Word document.

6. **Control Flow**

   * Throughout this process, Control Unit manages timing, instruction flow, and communication between devices using system buses.

```
[Input Devices] → [CPU: CU + ALU + Registers/Cache] ↔ [Primary Memory (RAM)]
                                          ↓
                                [Secondary Storage (HDD/SSD)]
                                          ↓
                                   [Output Devices]
```

✅ **In summary:**
The computer’s hardware components work like a pipeline. Input brings data, CPU processes it with help from memory, storage keeps it safe, and output devices show the result. The motherboard ties everything together, and power supply fuels the system.
