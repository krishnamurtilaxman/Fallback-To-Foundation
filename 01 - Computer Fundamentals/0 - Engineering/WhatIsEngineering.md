# **`1. What Engineering is not? (Debunking Stereotypes))`**

- Engineering is not just for "math geniuses".
    - You don't need to be a prodigy at calculus to be a great engineer.
    - Engineering is more about problem-solving, creativity, and persistence than raw math skills.

- Engineering is not a solitary job.
    - The "lonely engineer" stereotype is false.
    - Real-world engineering is highly collaborative - teams work together across discipline, often with designers, clients, and even marketing temas.

- Engineering is not just about machine or coding.
    - Engineering includes bioengineering, environmental design, materials science, systems thinking and more.
    - It's not limited to computers or engines - It's applied to health, sustainability, finance and beyond.

- Engineering is borig or rigid.
    - Far from it - engineering is deeply creative. 
    - It involves innovation, exploration, and designing "novel solutions" to real-world problems - from space exploration to wearable tech.

- Engineering is not only for men.
    - The stereotype that engineering is a "male profession" is outdated and harmful.
    - Women and underrepresented groups have always contributed - and continue to **reshape the future** of engineering.

# **`2. What is Real Engineering?`**

Formal definition of Engineering : Actually, engineering is a field in which pratical solutions are found using science. maths and technology. It is the process of thinking and implementing innovation and efficient ways to find a solution to any problem.

### **THINK FOR A MOMENT**

Engineering is all about problem solving so what is the main factor that help us to solve any particular problem?

**Engineering solution is totally based on a _principle._**

Example :- If we want to build an aeroplane we take advantage to the _"Bernoulli's Theorem"_ and _"Newton's laws of motion."_

### **What is a Principle?****

A final decision taken on the basis of sufficient evidance in the context of a subject in which there is no scope for any change called _principle._

### **Origin of Principle**

- It always starts from _doubt._
- After that we start our _experiments._
- Finally, we make a decision that is what we called as _principle._

The basic foundation of engineering is that we solve problems based on certain principles. These principles may be of science, mathematics or any other field, but without them we cannot find any solid solution. So, in this way we can say that there is a strong principle behind engineering. 

The basic purpose of engineering is to find a solution to a problem, and for this we use principles and theories. So essentially, the whole process of engineering is to understand any problem, find the right principles for it. and then find a solution. 

Actually, the job of engineering is to develop new principles and new theories when needed. Meaning, sometimes we have to work on existing principles, but sometimes we also create new principles, especially when a completely new and unique problem comes up. So engineering is in a way based on existing principles, and sometimes creates new principles as well.

# **`3. Sacrifices must be made.`**

If we look around we found engineering is everywhere but this journey was not too easy. There are people who devote their lives for this and there many of them who sacrifies their lives is just because to prove something is true. Should we neglate these peoples? 

Absolutely not! They are real heros and we should make them as our ideals because they risked their lives to discover new worlds. But, the people who made their mission possible are often lost in history.
