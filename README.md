# 🧱 Fallback To Foundation – Rebuilding My Developer Core

Welcome to **Fallback To Foundation**, a personal repository where I am intentionally hitting reset on my developer journey. Despite being a full stack web developer, I’ve decided to start again — **not from zero, but from the roots**.

---

## 💡 Why This Repository Exists

Over the years, I’ve learned web development primarily through **video tutorials**, crash courses, and hands-on projects. While this helped me build things and land work, I’ve often felt that my foundation lacks the depth and clarity needed to tackle **complex real-world challenges** or build **truly advanced applications**.

So I’m choosing to go **back to the beginning** — to rebuild my core, revise the fundamentals, and truly understand the *why* behind every concept.

This repository is where I’ll:

* Take detailed notes
* Practice core concepts
* Track my own progress
* Build knowledge **slowly but deeply**

---

## 🚧 What This Is Not

This isn’t a teaching resource. It’s not polished for others — it’s **raw, real, and personal**. You’re welcome to look around, but this repo is more of a **developer’s journal** than a structured course.

---

## 🧭 Learning Plan (From Ground Zero)

This journey covers everything from **basic computer knowledge** to **advanced web development**, including system design, networking, and beyond.

> ⚠️ Only the high-level roadmap is shown below. Detailed subtopics and resources are maintained within their respective folders.

## 🎯 My Intentions

* Break out of the **tutorial loop**
* Build **true confidence** in every concept
* Reconnect with **the joy of learning**
* Prepare myself to build bigger, better, smarter solutions

## 🔍 Current Status

📌 **Starting from C++** and **Computer Fundamentals**, working my way up.
This repo will evolve as I revise and move forward through each phase.
